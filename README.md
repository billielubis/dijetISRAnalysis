**Special notes for Chris:**

* In ATestRun_eljob.cxx: 
truthfiles.txt is a text file with just one file, i.e. 

/eos/user/b/blubis/NtuplesFromTRUTH1/new_samples/MC15.999999.MGPy8EG_N30LO_A14N23LO_S1_qqa_Ph100_mRp4_gASp25/MC15.999999.MGPy8EG_N30LO_A14N23LO_S1_qqa_Ph100_mRp4_gASp25.root

in it. I change which file it is to run over the different mass points. So right now they all run separately and I get a new output file for each mass point.
